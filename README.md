# kenpom_loss
Scrapes Kenpom via BeautifulSoup and finds the best and worst team for each number of losses. writes to csv.

I believe this would only work on Windows. Must have Excel.

You must install the following packages:
Beautiful Soup 4: https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/
requests: http://docs.python-requests.org/
  
The only bit of code that needs to be customized is the file path on line 11.
I have it saving to desktop but you can edit that to whatever you want
